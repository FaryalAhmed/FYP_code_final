# CS04 - Traffic Monitoring System

This repository serves as a compilation of the codes we used throughout the course of our Final Year Project. üí¶

We are working on the *Track 4* of the *AI City Challenge by NVIDIA* which is based on the **anomaly detection** in traffic videos.

Our project consists of:
- A Django based web portal. It consists of
     - Signup Page
     - Login Page
          - Forget Password Functionality.
     - Landing Page
     - Upload Page
     - Video Description Page
     - Video Preview Page
     - Gallery
     - Contact Us
- A deployment code for integration of the model with the website.

We have used ***3DCNN*** as our main model for this project. Our testing showed an accuracy of 90% on the test data. üïâÔ∏è
